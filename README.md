# Image-Detection-Machine-Learning-
 A generic image detection program that uses Google's Machine Learning library, Tensorflow and a pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called Inception.  This model has been pre-trained for the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge using the data from 2012, and it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian, dishwasher etc. The program applies Transfer Learning to this existing model and re-trains it to classify a new set of images.
